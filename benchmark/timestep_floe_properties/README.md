# Benchmark: `timestep_floe_properties!` on the GPU vs `main`

Compares `timestep_floe_properties!` on the `gpu-version` branch (KernelAbstractions
kernels on `FixedWidthFloes`) with the same function on `main` (a `Threads.@threads`
loop over the floe `StructArray`). The branch is benchmarked on the CPU backend and on
NVIDIA (CUDA.jl) or AMD (AMDGPU.jl) GPUs. The results below are from an NVIDIA GPU.

## Input

`make_floes.jl` builds the docs example `docs/literate/examples/shear_flow.jl` on a larger
domain:

- Same settings as the example: periodic boundaries, shear ocean flow (0 → 0.5 → 0 m/s),
  `Δgrid = 2e3`, `hmean = 0.25`, `Δh = 0`, `Δt = 20`, concentration 0.75, `Float64`,
  `SubGridPointsGenerator(npoint_per_cell = 2)`, `rng = Xoshiro(1)`.
- Instead of 50 floes on a 1e5 × 1e5 m domain, `nfloes = 10_000` on a 1.416e6 × 1.416e6 m
  domain (same floe density, so the floes have the same size). The generator made
  **10,029 floes**, with 7.0 vertices per floe on average.
- The simulation runs 100 timesteps (on the branch, CPU backend) so that velocities,
  forces, and collision interactions are realistic. After that, floes have 2.4
  interactions on average (at most 7).
- The floe fields are saved as plain arrays in `floes_10k.jld2`, so both Subzero
  versions load exactly the same floes. A Voronoi floe field isn't reproducible with a
  fixed `rng`, so a rerun gives a slightly different field.

Sizes benchmarked: 1,000 floes (the first 1,000), 10,000, and 100,000. For 100,000, the
10,029-floe field is copied 10 times, each copy shifted by `Lx` in x. The function works
on each floe independently, so this only scales the amount of work.

The floe settings are `FloeSettings()` (the default `DecayAreaScaledCalculator`,
`max_floe_height = 10`, `maximum_ξ = 1e-5`, as in the example).

## What is measured

All numbers come from BenchmarkTools (`evals = 1`, up to 15 s per benchmark). Every sample
starts from a fresh `deepcopy` of the input, made in `setup` and not timed.

- **main**: `timestep_floe_properties!(floes, 1, Δt, floe_settings)`. Its per-event
  `@info` logging is silenced with a `NullLogger`.
- **branch, kernels only**: `timestep_floe_properties!(dev_floes, Δt, floe_settings; backend)`
  followed by `KernelAbstractions.synchronize(backend)`, with `dev_floes` already on the
  device. This is 7 kernel launches.
- **branch, Float32 kernels only** (GPU only): the same, with every `Float64` array of the
  `FixedWidthFloes` converted to `Float32` and `FloeSettings(Float32)`. The kernels still do
  some `Float64` maths because of `Float64` literals (`1.5Δt`), see `AGENTS.md`.
- **branch, full step**: what `run!` does around the call: `FixedWidthFloes(floes)`,
  `adapt(backend, …)`, the kernels, `synchronize`, `adapt(Array, …)`, `update_floes!`,
  and `_log_flags`. It is also measured in parts.

Correctness check: `bench_main.jl` saves the result of one call on 1,000 floes, and
`bench_branch.jl` compares the branch's result with it (centroid, height, mass, moment, α,
velocities, previous-timestep values, stresses, strain). Both CPU and CUDA match `main`,
with a maximum relative difference of 6e-15.

## Machine and versions

## Results

Median time per call in ms (Float64 unless noted). The full output, with minimum times and
sample counts, is under [Example output](#example-output).

| Floes | main, 1 thread | main, 20 threads | branch CPU, 1 thread, kernels | branch CPU, 20 threads, kernels | branch CUDA, kernels | branch CUDA Float32, kernels |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,000   |   2.11 |  0.43 |  0.42 | 0.54 | 0.51 | 0.15 |
| 10,000  |  20.7  |  3.09 |  3.85 | 1.01 | 0.97 | 0.62 |
| 100,000 | 364    | 98.4  | 38.7  | 6.96 | 7.81 | 5.01 |

The full step as in `run!`, with the time spent in each part (branch, 20 threads):

| Floes | backend | full step | `FixedWidthFloes` | to device | kernels | to host | `update_floes!` |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,000   | CPU  |  0.84 |  0.17 | 0     | 0.54 | 0     |  0.13 |
| 1,000   | CUDA |  1.71 |  0.17 | 0.13  | 0.51 | 0.33  |  0.14 |
| 10,000  | CPU  |  4.42 |  2.74 | 0     | 1.01 | 0     |  1.36 |
| 10,000  | CUDA |  7.94 |  2.74 | 1.13  | 0.97 | 1.61  |  1.42 |
| 100,000 | CPU  |  64.5 |  36.7 | 0     | 6.96 | 0     |  15.9 |
| 100,000 | CUDA |   137 |  44.8 | 12.2  | 7.81 | 20.7  |  15.1 |

The 100,000-floe full-step and `update_floes!` numbers are based on only 5–6 samples,
because the untimed `deepcopy` in `setup` uses up most of the time budget. They are noisy:
the CUDA full step (137 ms) is well above the sum of its parts (about 100 ms).

## Observations

- **The kernels are fast.** With 10,000 floes, the CUDA kernels take 0.97 ms, against
  3.1 ms on `main` with 20 threads (3×) and 20.7 ms with 1 thread (21×). With 100,000
  floes it's 7.8 ms against 98 ms (13×) and 364 ms (47×). With 1,000 floes there isn't
  enough work: the time is dominated by 7 kernel launches plus a synchronize (about
  0.5 ms), and `main` is slightly faster.
- **The same kernels on the CPU backend are also much faster than `main`.** On this
  laptop, the kernels with 20 threads are as fast as the Float64 CUDA kernels. With 1
  thread they are 5–9× faster than `main` with 1 thread, because they don't allocate
  (`main` allocates in `calc_stress!`, `maximum(abs.(cforce))`, `_move_floe!`, …).
- **Float64 is slow on this GPU.** Converting the floes to Float32 makes the CUDA kernels
  1.5–3.5× faster, even with the remaining Float64 literals. A datacenter GPU (A100/H100)
  with full-rate Float64 would perform very differently.
- **In `run!`, the conversion costs more than it saves.** Converting the
  `StructArray{Floe}` to `FixedWidthFloes` and back (`update_floes!`) takes 4–8× as long
  as the kernels with 10,000 and 100,000 floes. On CUDA, the host↔device copies (about
  270–330 ns per floe) come on top of that. So the CUDA full step (7.9 ms at 10,000 floes) is currently slower than `main`
  with 20 threads (3.1 ms), and the CPU backend full step (4.4 ms) is too. The GPU only
  pays off once more of `timestep_sim!` runs on the device and the floes stay there
  between steps.
- `main` with 20 threads at 100,000 floes (98 ms, 3.7× faster than 1 thread) scales worse
  than at 10,000 floes (6.7×), probably because of GC pressure from its allocations.

```sh
REPO=/path/to/Subzero.jl            # checked out at the gpu-version commit
WORK=$(mktemp -d)                   # work directory for environments, input, and results
$REPO/benchmark/timestep_floe_properties/setup.sh "$WORK" 4b949fe   # worktree of main + 2 envs
cd "$WORK" && $REPO/benchmark/timestep_floe_properties/run_all.sh     # about 25 min
cat results/*.txt
git -C $REPO worktree remove "$WORK/subzero-main"                     # clean up afterwards
```

`run_all.sh` does the following:

1. `julia -t 8 --project=env-branch make_floes.jl 10000 100 floes_10k.jld2` generates the
   input (about 1 min). This is skipped if `floes_10k.jld2` exists in the work directory.
   To compare against these results, copy the input they used (`floes_10k.jld2` in this
   folder, 24 MB, not committed) into the work directory first.
2. `bench_main.jl` with the `main` environment, with 1 and 20 threads.
3. `bench_branch.jl` with the branch environment, with 1 thread (CPU only,
   `BENCH_BACKENDS=CPU`) and 20 threads (CPU and GPU).

`setup.sh` adds CUDA.jl to the branch environment if `nvidia-smi` is found, and AMDGPU.jl
if `rocminfo` or `rocm-smi` is found. To choose yourself, set `BENCH_GPU`, for example
`BENCH_GPU=AMDGPU setup.sh "$WORK"` (or `BENCH_GPU=""` for no GPU package).

Environment variables for the benchmark scripts: `BENCH_SIZES` (comma-separated numbers of
floes, default `1000,10000,100000`), `BENCH_SECONDS` (time budget per benchmark, default
10; `run_all.sh` uses 15), `BENCH_BACKENDS` (comma-separated,
from `CPU`, `CUDA`, `AMDGPU`; default `CPU` plus each of CUDA.jl and AMDGPU.jl that is in
the environment and has a working GPU), and `BENCH_FLOES` (input
file, default `floes_10k.jld2`). Run `bench_main.jl` before `bench_branch.jl`, because it
writes `result_main.jld2` for the correctness check.
